# My Prompt Engineering Practices
Here, I document my prompts for each Language Model (LLM) I collaborate with. I am committed to enhancing my prompt-writing skills to optimize model performance. 

### **Prompt 1**: 
```
You are a psychologist. Show me some examples of sentences told by people and show me the effection of each ego state in the sentence.
show the power of each ego state by pecent in each sentence. in this format
1. [...the sentence] : [adult: "the percent", child: "the percent", parent: "the percent"]
bring at least 10 sentences.
```

### **Answer (ChatGPT 3.5)**:
```
Sure, here are ten example sentences along with an analysis of the ego states present in each sentence:

1. "I think it's best to approach this situation with caution." : Adult: 80%, Parent: 15%, Child: 5%
2. "You should always listen to your elders; they know best." : Parent: 90%, Adult: 5%, Child: 5%
3. "I feel really excited about the upcoming trip!" : Child: 70%, Adult: 20%, Parent: 10%
4. "It's important to follow the rules and regulations set by the authorities." : Parent: 80%, Adult: 15%, Child: 5%
5. "I remember feeling scared when I was in a similar situation before." : Child: 60%, Adult: 30%, Parent: 10%
6. "Let's logically assess the pros and cons before making a decision." : Adult: 90%, Parent: 5%, Child: 5%
7. "I always feel guilty when I don't meet others' expectations." : Child: 60%, Parent: 30%, Adult: 10%
8. "You shouldn't trust strangers; it's better to be safe than sorry." : Parent: 70%, Adult: 20%, Child: 10%
9. "I feel so happy when I spend time with my loved ones." : Child: 70%, Adult: 20%, Parent: 10%
10. "It's important to be polite and respectful to everyone we meet." : Parent: 70%, Adult: 20%, Child: 10%

These percentages are approximate estimations and may vary depending on interpretation. They illustrate the dominance of certain ego states in each sentence.

1. "This test is too hard, I'm going to fail!": [Adult: 20%, Child: 70%, Parent: 10%] - Here, the Child's fear and frustration dominate (70%), with the Adult recognizing the situation (20%) and the Parent offering a little critical judgment (10%).

### Prompt 2:
```
I am learning how to work with large language models. I put my exercises and prompts in a GitHub repository. I follow these tutorials on Shaw Talebi's YouTube channel.
I put both the codes I write and the prompts I write.
I want you to write a readme in markdown format.
* Point to the codes I write in one section (the codes are written in Google colab)
* Point to the prompts that I write in a section
* Each section should not be more than 100 words.
* I am going to copy the text directly. Avoid writing additions
also add a sentence at the end that the readme is written by a prompt in ChatGpt 3.5
```
