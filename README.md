# Learning with Large Language Models

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I document my journey of learning to work with large language models! Here you'll find exercises, prompts, and code snippets related to natural language processing.

## Code Samples

In this section, you'll find the codes I've written to experiment with large language models. These codes are executed on Google Colab for ease of access and collaboration.

## Prompts

Here, I share the prompts I've crafted to generate various text outputs using large language models. These prompts serve as inputs to generate diverse and interesting responses from the models.
